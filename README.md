# SEAL EC
I have gotten far in my quest for the dumbest idea, however this one cannot go along with the rest.
SEAL EC (Sir Eats A Lot Extended CMD) is designed to expand the usefulness and ease of batch, and add shit they didn't.

## FEATURES

So far I have the main console, which will run just like the regular CMD, but the real fun begins with a simple character.
Adding '+' before certain commands will open it in the EC. You can type +help to see th available commands.
Adding the initial commands is easy, but shit starts to hit the fan when I finally break down and start using arguments. An example of this is the range command. To use it, you would type '+range <startrange> <endrange> <testthisvar>' into the console. It prints out '1' or '0' for true or false. One of the key features that I'll be adding is *execute*. You'll be able to run any files as batch files. Also to come, encrypting. Now, I don't think I'll be able to make some hardcore CIA breaker encryption *that you would know about*, but it will keep some random dweeb from finding your secret ascii porn collection... for a few minutes.
