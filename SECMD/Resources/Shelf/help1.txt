All normal CMD commands still work inside the cmd such
as "help" "cls" and "echo !time!".
Due to some weird error, variables cannot be the standard
"%var%" but instead have to typed like !var!.
All utilitues are meant to be called by seperate programs,
and the extended CMD should not replace your general use
with the CMD, as some things do not work in it. It is purely
for user interface with configs and preferences, and some
documentation.

Didn't read any of that? Don't worry, neither did I!
